# Python image to a video project

For this project, I am going to use proper core Python including the two most popular image libraries of python.
First [Open CV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
Second [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)

There is also other most popular Python libraries like as:
[Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
[Sci-Pi)(https://www.scipy.org/)
[MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/)
[Mahotas](https://mahotas.readthedocs.io/) | [Mahotas GitHub](https://github.com/luispedro/mahotas)
[SimpleTK](http://www.simpleitk.org/SimpleITK/help/documentation.html)

I am going to discuss all of these libraries in future upcoming projects or tutorials but for now, I am going to use the first two libraries mentions first.

This is a very normal and very easy project using only core Python with a few lines of codes with two folders.
For this project, we need one folder where we have our images
Other folder used for storing converted video

This project is just for the beginning to understand Python library very well before I am discussed about NumPy library in which I also covered lots of libraries like as matplotlib and other mentioned libraries covered on that NumPy project.

If you are interested in number so you can visit my YouTube channel by the name of [heysushil](https://youtube.com/heysushil) and find out the playlist of NumPy library.

Also, you are most welcome to you contribute and this project.
